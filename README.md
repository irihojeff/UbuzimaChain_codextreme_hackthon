- Upon login, a token is issued, and users are routed to role-based dashboards.

### Dashboards:
- **Admin Dashboard:** View a table of all registered patients.
- **Doctor Dashboard:** Placeholder for patient management and scheduling.
- **Patient Dashboard & MyProfile:** View and manage personal profiles.

### Authorization:
- Patients can authorize doctors to access their records securely.

## Future Roadmap

- **Stable Memory Upgrades:** Persist state across canister deploys.
- **Smart Contract Automation:** Automate appointment scheduling and triage.
- **AI-Driven Recommendations:** Improve doctor matching based on real-time data.
- **Enhanced Dashboards:** Add filtering, sorting, and system statistics.
- **Profile Modification:** Enable patients to update their profiles post-registration.

## ðŸŒŸ Innovative Vision

### **UbuzimaSpark: Where Smart Contracts and AI Light the Way to Faster, Safer Healthcare**

Imagine a healthcare system where every appointment and emergency triage is handled by **self-executing smart contracts**â€”eliminating long queues and errors.

With **UbuzimaSpark**, patient registration instantly triggers **automated scheduling**, urgent cases are prioritized, and records are securely stored **on-chain**. AI-powered recommendations ensure that patients receive **timely, personalized care**.

This isnâ€™t just another hospital management systemâ€”itâ€™s a **decentralized, automated ecosystem** that transforms healthcare delivery and saves lives.
