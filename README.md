# UbuzimaChain: Decentralized Healthcare Automation via Smart Contracts and AI

UbuzimaChain is a next-generation healthcare platform that redefines patient management by leveraging blockchain, smart contracts, and AI. Our solution goes beyond traditional hospital management systemsâ€”automating critical processes, ensuring data integrity, and enhancing security to reduce waiting times and mitigate medical risks.

## Features

### Decentralized Data Storage
- Patient records are stored on-chain for immutability and transparency.

### Secure User Authentication
- **Registration:** Users register with roles (Patient, Doctor, Admin) and passwords are securely hashed.
- **Login:** Secure login with token generation and role-based routing.

### Patient Management
- **Patient Registration:** Patients register and have their data stored securely.
- **Profile Retrieval:** Patients can view their profiles via a dedicated dashboard.
- **Doctor Authorization:** Patients can grant doctors access to their records.

### Role-Based Dashboards
- **Admin Dashboard:** Displays a comprehensive table of all registered patients.
- **Doctor Dashboard:** Provides a placeholder UI for future patient management and appointment scheduling.
- **Patient Dashboard & MyProfile:** Enable patients to view and manage their own profiles.

### Future Enhancements
- **Smart Contract Automation:** Automated appointment booking and triage to reduce waiting times.
- **AI-Driven Recommendations:** Intelligent matching of patients with the best available doctors.
- **Profile Modification:** Allow patients to update their details post-registration.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Dashboard enhancements for filtering, sorting, and real-time system statistics.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Authentication Module:**
   - Implements user registration and login.
   - Users are stored in a global state (`STATE`) and mapped from principal IDs to user IDs via `PRINCIPAL_TO_USER`.

2. **Patients Module:**
   - Provides endpoints for patient registration, fetching individual patient details, and admin retrieval of all patients.
   - Uses a two-step lookup in `get_all_patients()` to ensure that only Admins can access patient records.

3. **State Management:**
   - Uses thread-local storage (`RefCell<HashMap<...>>`) for users, patients, and principal-to-user mappings.
   - In development, state resets on each deployment; stable memory persistence is planned for production.

4. **Frontend Components:**
   - **Authentication Components:** Separate Login and Registration (PatientRegistration) components with error handling and role-based redirection.
   - **Dashboard Components:** Role-specific dashboards for Admins, Doctors, and Patients.
   - **Error Boundaries:** Capture runtime errors and display friendly messages.
   - **Routing:** Managed via React Router for seamless navigation.
