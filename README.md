UbuzimaChain: Decentralized Healthcare Automation via Smart Contracts and AI

UbuzimaChain is a next-generation healthcare platform designed to revolutionize hospital management. Leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, our system ensures data integrity, enhances security, and automates critical processes—reducing waiting times and minimizing human error. With a modular architecture, UbuzimaChain offers a robust solution for patient registration, authentication, and management, while paving the way for future AI-driven enhancements.

Features
Decentralized Data Storage:
Patient records are stored securely using blockchain principles, ensuring immutability and transparency.

User Authentication:

Registration: Users can register with roles (Patient, Doctor, Admin) and secure their accounts with hashed passwords.
Login: Secure login with token generation and role-based routing.
Patient Management:

Patient Registration: Patients can register and update their profile.
Profile Retrieval: Patients can view their own profiles; admins can view all registered patients.
Doctor Authorization: Patients can grant doctors access to their records.
Role-Based Dashboards:

Admin Dashboard: Displays a table of all registered patients (future enhancements include system statistics and user management).
Doctor Dashboard: A placeholder for managing patient appointments and activities.
Patient Dashboard: Enables patients to view their profile and register if they haven’t done so.
Future Enhancements:

Smart Contract Automation: Automated appointment booking and triage to reduce waiting times.
AI-Driven Recommendations: Matching patients with the best available doctors based on various criteria.
Profile Modification: Allow patients to update their details post-registration.
Advanced Analytics: Integrate system statistics, filtering, and audit logs for admins.
Technical Stack
Backend:

Language: Rust
Framework: ic-cdk and ic-cdk-macros
Blockchain Integration: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)
Data Storage: In-memory state with pre_upgrade/post_upgrade hooks for state persistence (to be implemented for production)
Frontend:

Library: React
Tooling: Vite, Tailwind CSS
Routing: React Router
API Communication: Dfinity Agent for canister calls
Architecture Overview
Authentication Module:

Implements user registration and login.
Users are stored in a global state (STATE), and a mapping (PRINCIPAL_TO_USER) links principals to user IDs.
Patients Module:

Provides endpoints for patient registration, fetching individual patient details, and admin access to all patients.
Ensures that only authorized users can access or modify patient data.
State Management:

Uses thread-local storage (RefCell<HashMap<...>>) to manage users, patients, and mappings.
In development, state resets on each deploy; future upgrades will implement stable memory persistence.
Frontend Components:

Auth Components: Login and Registration forms with error handling and role-based redirection.
Dashboard Components: Separate dashboards for Admin, Doctor, and Patient views.
Error Boundaries: Catch runtime errors to enhance user experience.
Installation & Deployment
Prerequisites
DFX SDK
Rust
Node.js and npm
Backend (Canister) Setup
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
cd UbuzimaChain_backend
cargo install --locked
Build and Deploy the Canister:

bash
Copy
dfx deploy
Note: State resets on each deploy during development. For production, implement stable memory upgrades.

Frontend Setup
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
cd UbuzimaChain_frontend
npm install
Run the Development Server:

bash
Copy
npm start
Build for Production:

bash
Copy
npm run build
Usage
Registration & Login:
Users can register by providing a username, password, and role. After registration, users log in to receive a token.

Dashboards:

Patients: Access their profile via the Patient Dashboard.
Doctors: Use the Doctor Dashboard (under development) to manage patients.
Admins: View all patient records via the Admin Dashboard.
Authorization:
Patients can authorize doctors to access their records, ensuring secure, role-based data sharing.

Future Roadmap
Stable Memory Upgrades: Persist state across canister deployments.
Smart Contract Automation: Integrate automated appointment scheduling and triage to reduce waiting times.
AI Enhancements: Build intelligent doctor recommendation and predictive analytics.
Enhanced Dashboards: Add filtering, sorting, and real-time system statistics for admins and doctors.
